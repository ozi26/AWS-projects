# :computer: Real-Time Visitor Counter With Logs (AWS Cloud Project)

This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, serverless visitor counter with timestamped visit logs, IP address, and user agent details, powered entirely by AWS services.

#  Overview

The Real-Time Visitor Counter with Logs project is a cloud-native, serverless web application that tracks and logs website visitors in real time. It demonstrates how modern cloud services can be combined to build scalable, cost-efficient, and production-ready applications without managing traditional servers.

At its core, this application performs two main functions:
   + Counts website visits in real time ‚Äì every new visit automatically updates the counter.
   + Logs visit details ‚Äì including timestamp, IP address, and user agent for each request.

These logs can be retrieved through a dedicated API endpoint, making it easy to analyze traffic history.
# Purpose & Problem Solved
In many scenarios‚Äîsuch as personal blogs, portfolio sites, marketing campaigns, or internal dashboards‚Äîthere is a need to track user activity without relying on heavy external analytics platforms (like Google Analytics).

This project provides:

‚úÖ A lightweight alternative to complex analytics solutions

‚úÖ Full transparency & control over collected data (stored securely in DynamoDB)

‚úÖ A serverless, pay-as-you-go model, making it cost-effective for individuals and startups

‚úÖ A foundation for custom analytics dashboards and visitor insights

# Features
+ üî¢ Real-Time Visitor Counter ‚Äì Increments every time someone visits.
  
+ üïí Visit Logs with Timestamps ‚Äì Stores each visit with date/time in DynamoDB.
  
+ üåê Visitor Info Capture ‚Äì Stores IP address & user agent.
  
+ üìä API Endpoints ‚Äì
  
   + `/count` ‚Üí Returns updated visitor count.
   + `/logs` ‚Üí Returns all past visit logs.
+ ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless Architecture ‚Äì Scales automatically with zero server management.
  
+ üîí Secure & Cost-Efficient ‚Äì Pay only for what you use.

# AWS Services Used
   + Amazon DynamoDB ‚Üí NoSQL database to store counts and logs.
     
   + AWS Lambda ‚Üí Backend logic to process requests.
     
   + Amazon API Gateway ‚Üí Secure REST API endpoints.
     
   + Amazon CloudWatch ‚Üí Logs and monitoring.
     
   + (Optional) Amazon S3 + CloudFront ‚Üí Host frontend webpage.  

# Prerequisites
   + An AWS account (free tier is fine).
     
   + A modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
     
   + (Optional but handy) Python 3 installed so you can run a tiny local web server:
     
      + In PowerShell: `python --version` ‚Üí if missing, download from python.org.
        
   + (Optional) VS Code to edit files comfortably.
     
     > Note: Windows Operating System

#  Architecture Highlights

The project leverages multiple AWS services to achieve seamless functionality:

   + Amazon API Gateway ‚Üí Exposes secure REST endpoints (/count and /logs)

   + AWS Lambda ‚Üí Executes backend logic without managing servers

   + Amazon DynamoDB ‚Üí Stores both the visitor count and detailed logs

   + Amazon CloudWatch ‚Üí Provides centralized logging and monitoring

   + Amazon S3 + CloudFront (Optional) ‚Üí Hosts the frontend web application globally

This architecture is event-driven, highly available, and scales automatically to handle any number of visitors.

#  AWS Setup Instructions
Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ 
+ Create the IAM role for Lambda
  
  + Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
  + Open `IAM` ‚Üí `Roles` ‚Üí Create role.
  + Trusted entity type: AWS service.
  + Use case: Choose Lambda ‚Üí Next.
  +  Permissions: Search and attach AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
    (This lets Lambda write logs to CloudWatch).
  + Role name: `lambda-joke-role ‚Üí Create role`.
---
Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ 
+ Create the Lambda function (`python 3.18x`)
  
  + Go to `AWS Lambda` ‚Üí Create function.
  + Author from scratch:
  + Function name: random-joke-lambda
  + Runtime: `Node.js 20.x`
  + Architecture: `x86_64` (default is fine)
  + Change default execution role: Use an existing role ‚Üí select lambda-joke-role
  + Click Create function.
  + Add the code
  + In the code editor (`index.mjs` or `index.js` area), replace the contents with your lambda code.
    
+ Set environment variable (optional)
  
  + In the Lambda‚Äôs Configuration tab ‚Üí Environment variables ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Add:
  + Key: `JOKE_API_URL`
  + Value: `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`
  + Save. (This makes it easy to switch APIs later.)
    
+ Increase Lambda timeout
  
  + Configuration ‚Üí General configuration ‚Üí Edit:
  + Timeout: set to 10 seconds ‚Üí Save.
  + Test the function
---
Step 3Ô∏è‚É£
+ Create the API Gateway HTTP API ( We‚Äôll expose a GET /joke route that invokes your Lambda ).
  
  + Go to API Gateway ‚Üí Create API ‚Üí choose HTTP API (not REST).
  + Build ‚Üí Add integration: choose Lambda ‚Üí select your region & random-joke-lambda.
    
+ Configure routes:
  
  + Method: `GET`
  + Resource path: `/joke`
  + Integration target: your Lambda
    
+ CORS (important):
  
  + In the API‚Äôs left sidebar, click CORS (or during creation if prompted).
  + Enable CORS.
  + Allow origins: `* `(dev-friendly; you can restrict later to your exact domain)
  + Allow methods: `GET`, `OPTIONS`
  + Allow headers: `Content-Type`
  + Expose headers: (leave empty)
  + Save.
  + Deploy (HTTP APIs auto-create a $default stage, but ensure you Deploy or Publish if prompted).
    
+ Find your Invoke URL
  
  + In the API‚Äôs Stages (likely $default), copy the Invoke URL.
  + Your full endpoint will be: (https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/joke)
---
Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ 
Build the Frontend (single file).  Create a new file on your PC: `index.html` (any folder). Paste the complete html code and change the API GATEWAY URL.

+ (Optional) Host the frontend on Amazon S3 (Static Website)
  
  + Go to `S3` ‚Üí Create bucket:
  + Bucket name: unique (e.g., praise-random-joke-123)
  + Region: same region as your API (recommended)
  + Uncheck ‚ÄúBlock all public access‚Äù (for simple static hosting demo).
  + Acknowledge the warning ‚Üí Create bucket.
  + Upload index.html to the bucket.
  + Bucket ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí scroll to Static website hosting:
  + Enable ‚Üí Index document: `index.html` ‚Üí Save.
  + Copy the Bucket website endpoint (e.g., http://praise-random-joke-123.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).
  + Permissions ‚Üí Bucket policy ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí paste (replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME):
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
       {
      "Sid": "PublicReadForStaticWebsite",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
        }
      ]
    }
  ```
> Because your API Gateway CORS is Allow-Origin: *, your S3-hosted page can call it without extra changes. In production, restrict CORS to your exact S3 website origin.

# Future Improvements
   + üîê Add authentication for logs endpoint
     
   + üìç  Track location with IP geolocation API
     
   + üìä Visualize logs with charts (e.g., Chart.js)
     
   + ‚è≥  Add retention policy to old logs
